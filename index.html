I earned my MBA in business administration, I feel very accomplished that I graduated without the help of the internet!</p>

          <p class="response">I previously worked as a research assistant under Lawrence Summers at World Bank. I knew him very closely throughout my years at Harvard as he was my senior thesis adviser. After receiving my MBA, I worked at McKinsey & Company, and later worked along Summers once again for 5 years at the US Treasure Department as the chief of staff. I then joined Google in 2001 to work there for 7 years as the vice president of global online sales and operations.</p>

I became a better leader and was able to comfortably connect to all my coworkers and subordinates. I had real experience in the workforce and understood the business flow. Working as Summer's research assistant helped me land the role at the US Treasury Department as he knew I was a hard working person with a growing mindset.</p>

          <p class="response">When I first joined Facebook, everyone was so disconnected. It didn't quite feel like a team, a community. I immediately strived to build a connection to the hundreds of employees, as Zuckerberg failed to do so. The company has a difficult time making profit, so I suggested that advertisment would be the most effective way of achieving revenue. The company soon became available to sharholders in 2012, and Facebook's revenue grew by over 65 times. It is now the fourth most valuable tech company in the world.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="response">This one is easy. As you can imagine, I don't love to reminisce the most difficult part of my life. My husband, Dave Goldberg, passed in 2015 due to a heart arrhythmia. We were in Mexico celebrating a friends birthday. I couldn't find him all morning the day after we arrived. I soon found him on the floor of the hotel gym, with a pool of bright red blood around his delicate head. The hardest part was telling my kids that their father had died without any goodbyes. It was much too sudden, and I grieved. A lot. My work and personal life were affected heavily, and it made it really tough year.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="response">I often stayed home to comfort my kids. It started to become a regular habit. We would sit on our couch, thinking about what could have happened. It didn't take me long to realize that if I kept on allowing my kids and myself to stay home, we wouldn't get over the fact that their beloved father had died. It changed my management style at work. I didn't automatically take away the work from people facing personal issues. Instead, I asked them if they wanted or needed to do it, because I belive that relieving people of their reponsibilities could mean they didn't find their bearings. I came back with a fresh and new perspective. I took this as an opportunity to focus and reunite my family. I took an awful situation into a growth opportunity.</p>

            <span class="ask">How did your connections, reputation and opportunities advance your career? Isn’t someone’s success directly correlated to primarily experience and education?</span>
          </div>
          <p class="response">Many believe that education and experience alone can get you to the top. They're wrong. There are so many different factors including reputation, opportunities, influences and connections. If a brilliant person who can solve equation out there doesn't know how to communicate and build relations to other people, that genius will get no where, unfortunately. The people I have met and the connections I have made have heavily influenced and made me grow to the person I am today. If I hadn't met Lawrence Summers at Harvard, I wouldn't have progressed my career as quickly. If I hadn't been invited to that Christmas party where I met Zuckerberg, I may not have discussed transferring over to Facebook from Google with him as soon as I did. If I hadn’t worked at Google, I would not have created the reputation for myself as a technology executive, meaning I may not have landed the role I work as today.</p>

          <p class="response">Well, first of all, my parents. My dad was a doctor, and my mom was a French teacher who dropped her PHD to take care of my siblings and I. They both held high expectations for all of us which really pushed us to do well during school and university. Both of my siblings now have medical backgrounds and I consider us quite a successful group if I do say so myself. The chairman of washington post, Don Graham, helped me navigate through difficult professional situations, and Pat Mitchell, the CEO of the Plaey Center, encouraged and supported me to publicly speak out about women in the workforce and values that I believe in.</p>
